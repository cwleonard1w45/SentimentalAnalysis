# SentimentalAnalysis
Model understanding sentiments through words: a quite popular logistic regression model project for understanding the IMDB movie reviews and performing 'EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS' to predict a labelled dataset. 'FEATURE EXTRACTED' to be segregated into bad, good, very good, and very bad categories. And visualized with the help of 'CLOUD WORD.'
